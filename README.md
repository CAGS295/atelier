# atelier

A Computational Workshop for Market Microstructure Modeling, Synthetic Simulation and Historical Replay.

## Overview

Use `atelier` for modeling market microstructure dynamics, it supports an `orderbook-based` market structure. Whether you need a high quality reproduction of any given market within a defined period of time (market replay), or, to generate `what-if` scnearios either completely random, or, with model specification (market simulation).
