Rye is a comprehensive project and package management solution for Python.
Born from [its creator's](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) desire to establish a
one-stop-shop for all Python users, Rye provides a unified experience to install and manages Python
installations, `pyproject.toml` based projects, dependencies and virtualenvs
seamlessly.  It's designed to accommodate complex projects, monorepos and to
facilitate global tool installations.  Curious? [Watch an introduction](https://youtu.be/q99TYA7LnuA).

A hassle-free experience for Python developers at every level.
